The E$RI 'versus' or 'with' OSGeo?
==================================

No doubt, last FOSS4G in Nottingham was great, with more distance, we will see,
whether it was #bestfoss4gever or not, but who cares? We had fun, we did a lot
of work (speaking for the OSGeo Board) and we all simply had great time.
Again, people were sitting in corners and showing the code to each other (not so often, than
it was in Lausanne, but still). Again workshops were full, again
great presentations and more over important and inspiring keynotes.

But one thing was disturbing me all over the conference. Some people during their
presentations, even keynotes, used to say, instead of 'ESRI'
'E'&nbsp;'$'&nbsp;'R'&nbsp;'I'. Why I consider this bad?

Everybody knows the big companies in IT business, such as Microsoft, Oracle,
Google or in our field of work more known ESRI.
